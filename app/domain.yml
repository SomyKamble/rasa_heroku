  utter_covid_19_info:
  - text: COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
        discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
        before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

  utter_covid_19_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
          dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
          congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
          usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
          donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
          (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
          treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
          becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
          and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
          heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
          People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
          attention.
